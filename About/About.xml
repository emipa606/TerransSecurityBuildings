[h1][b]TERRAN’S SECURITY BUILDINGS[/b][/h1]

A simple mod added three types of security buildings from StarCraft II into Rimworld.

[h1][b]New Resource: [/b][/h1]
Chem-Gas (or you can call it Vespene Gas)
Made in Biofuel Refinery
Use Uranium and Chemfuel to produce

[h1][b]New Buildings: [/b][/h1]
Auto-turret 
An airborne automatic turret for fixed-point defense
Need Chem-Gas to work
Can provide 160w power
Explode when receiving serious damage

Bunker
	Fortifications that can accommodate four combatants. Full-angle firing holes allow soldiers to fire at the enemy outside from inside the bunker with ease.
	Source Code comes from: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2235810677&amp;amp;searchtext=bunker
	Can Upgrade (WIP. Because I’m a noob in C#, I’ll try my best)

Known issue for 1.2: 

when you using bunker, Shield Generators by Frontier Developments and Alpha Animal these three together, your pawn will not shoot in Bunker. This is caused by MVCF, a part for Vanilla Expanded Framework. I have no ability to fix this bug, sorry :(

For version 1.3: There are currently no compatibility issues found in version 1.3

Planetary Fortress
	A strong defensive fortress equipped with the "Twin Ibiks Cannon.
Need Chem-Gas to work
Can provide 2000w power
Can be used as 2000w battery
Provide a mood buff
Explode when receiving serious damage

All Turrets can set forced targets manually to make sure you don't waste your firepower

Settings:
You can set your buildings' HP from 1 to 99999 based on your modlist and game experience

[h1][b]Expanded mods:[/b][/h1]
This mod needs Harmony. They are just turrets.
But I make two patches for it.

[b]Using with S.R.T.S: [/b]
Auto-Turret and Planetary-Fortress can be used as a SRTS ship. You can send them to enemy’s base as a kind of weapon.

[b]Using with SOS2: [/b]
Auto-Turret and Planetary-Fortress can use the HOVER function. HOWEVER, their flying ability is based on SRTS. So, remember, SRTS ship will cause some bugs in SOS2’s World-Components.
